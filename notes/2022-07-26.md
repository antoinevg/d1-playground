# Plan for today

I have a working blink + uart loop

Let's try and get a basic timer working. Ideally, I'll probably want Timer0/1 working, as well as the RTC. After I get the timers working, I'll want interrupts as well to be able to respond to things.

But let's start with the timer driver.

Page 171 has the steps to enable the timer:

1. Configure the timer parameters clock source, prescale factor, and timing mode by writing **TMRn_CTRL_REG**. There is no sequence requirement of configuring the parameters.
2. Write the interval value.
    * Write TMRn_INTV_VALUE_REG to configure the interval value for the timer.
    * Write bit[1] of TMRn_CTRL_REG to load the interval value to the timer. The value of the bit will be cleared automatically after loading the interval value.
3. Write bit[0] of TMRn_CTRL_REG to start the timer. To get the current value of the timer, read
TMRn_CUR_VALUE_REG.

Timer registers exist around 177.
